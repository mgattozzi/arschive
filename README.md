# chronicle.rs

Welcome! This website records the history of the
[Rust programming language][rust].

This is a community run project not managed by any single individual. If you
would like to get involved, we have a number of ways for you to participate!

We need people to:

* Contribute content about the history of Rust
* Review other people's contributions
* Help organize issues and the project as a whole
* Help with the website design and fix problems that come up
* Design tools to help us archive pages from different websites (GitHub, Reddit,
  Twitter)
* Manage the website infrastructure, CI, etc.

This is a big project with lots to do! We know it's possible with your help!

[Our website][website] talks more about the vision of this project and the types
of things we are trying to archive.

Once you figure out what kinds of things you want to contribute, we have a
detailed [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) to get you started.
