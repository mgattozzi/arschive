  <h1>
    Welcome to Chronicle.rs!
  </h1>
  <p class="subtitle">
    In this day and age history on the web comes and goes quickly.
  </p>
  <p>
    We don't think much
    about how comments and discussion around things shapes decisions. Some things don't even happen
    online and important decisions are made offline.
  </p>
  <p>
    Programming language communities are the same.
    They come and they go, but the people who make it shape its culture, community, and code. Rust
    is no different. In an effort to preserve the here and now, as well as what has already come
    before, this site will collect all of that for others to look at and learn from.
  </p>
  <p>
    In general this means:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li> We'll try to get interviews with those in the community as a primary source </li>
    <li> We'll chronicle existing sources of text such as git repos and issues</li>
    <li> We'll chronicle RFCs and the discussions surrounding them</li>
    <li> We'll chronicle jokes and all the conversations that happen in "unofficial" places</li>
    <li> We'll chronicle big events as they occur and document previous ones </li>
    <li> We'll chronicle interesting things and provide articles like, "Why are libraries named
         crates?"
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This and more will be the main goal of this site. To preserve the fleeting moments of now for
    future users, to answer the interesting questions of why certain things were done, and as a
    way for people to learn from it.
